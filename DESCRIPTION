Description: Provides 'Shiny gadgets' to search, type, and insert IPA symbols
    into documents or scripts, requiring only knowledge about phonetics or 
    'X-SAMPA'. Also provides functions to facilitate the rendering of IPA
    symbols in 'LaTeX' and PDF format, making IPA symbols properly rendered
    in all output formats. A minimal R Markdown template for authoring 
    Linguistics related documents is also bundled with the package. Some
    helper functions to facilitate authoring with R Markdown is also provided.
