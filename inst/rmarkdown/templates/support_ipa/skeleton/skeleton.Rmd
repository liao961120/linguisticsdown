## A Template Compatible with IPA Symbols

This is an R Markdown template bundled with the package [linguisticsdown](https://liao961120.github.io/linguisticsdown).
You can insert IPA symbols in the document easily with a shiny gadget by calling `linguisticsdown::writeIPA()`.

By chosing "**LaTeX**" in "**Insert Format**" in the shiny gadget, you can compile this R Markdown document to both PDF and HTML with proper IPA symbols rendered.

## Fonts Supporting IPA Symbols

Make sure you have **at least one font supporting IPA symbols on your computer** so that IPA symbols can be properly rendered.
**Doulos SIL** is recommended and can be freely dowloaded [here](https://software.sil.org/doulos/download/).

For other fonts supporting IPA symbols, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Typefaces) for details.

**If you use fonts other than "Doulos SIL", make sure to set that font in line 16 of `header.tex`:**

```tex
\newfontfamily\ipa{font_name} 
```
