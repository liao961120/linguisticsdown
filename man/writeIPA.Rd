\description{
\code{writeIPA} opens a shiny gadget in the viewer pane of RStudio
to let users insert a sequence of IPA symbols into
the source pane or console.
Users can choose to use phonetic features (such as
\emph{aspirated}, \emph{schwa},
\emph{vl}(voiceless) / \emph{vd}(voiced), etc.) to find IPA
symbols or use the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA}{X-SAMPA}
input method directly. Note that due to the special
meanings of backslash(\code{\\}) in programming,
\strong{backslashes(\code{\\}) in X-SAMPA symbols are
replaced with slashes(\code{/})}.
